Google Analytics Capstone Project

I completed this case study as final work of "Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate" course.

I chose the Case Study "How does a bike-share navigate speed success?"

1) Objective 

The goal is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. To do so, it is important to understand how members and casual riders differ.

2) Prepare

Data are located on the company Divvy Bikes website. Data are organized by month and they not show issues related to bias.
Checking data integrity, I found out data showed some anomalies that I showed in the pdf presentation.

3) Process 

I chose to start working on Google Sheets. I made Data Cleaning: removed duplicates, fixed Dates and time formatting opting for conditional formatting, filtered data and shifted data that showed up as outliers.
I calculated ride lenghts and found anomalies regarding negative ride duration, that I fixed. I opted for aggregate functions such as minimum, maximum and average ride lenghts to end checking of data quality.
Many NULL cells were present in the geographical columns. 

4) Analysis

I worked pivoting data, working first on trends comparing the first three months of 2021, then focusing on March 2021.
Then I worked on BigQuery and queried data to go on exploring data (Aggregate functions and calculations).

5) Viz

I then imported the analysis outputs on Tableau and prepared two dashboard with visualizations of insights.
Here the links to both the Dashoboards:

and 
https://public.tableau.com/views/Google_Capstone_Time/Dashboard1?:language=it-IT&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link (this compared to the first dashboard includes the time variable)

6) Act

The conclusions and the suggestion I elaborated are shown on the pdf presentation.
